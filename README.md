# ANIDS
Anomaly Based Network Intrusion Detection System Using Ensemble Machine Learning
 Overview

This project aims to build a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that detects abnormal or malicious network traffic using Machine Learning algorithms.
The system analyzes network flow features to distinguish between normal and attack traffic efficiently.

It uses multiple classification algorithms and a Stacking Ensemble Model to improve detection accuracy and reduce false positives.
